stdout = """
Display a diff predicting the changes that would be merged if you merged your working tree.

The diff includes uncommitted changes, unlike `git diff <target>...`.  It is produced by diffing the working tree against the merge base of <target> and HEAD.

Usage: oaf merge-diff [OPTIONS] [PATH]...

Arguments:
  [PATH]...
          

Options:
  -t, --target <TARGET>
          The branch you would merge into.  (Though any commitish will work.)

      --myers
          Use the meyers diff algorithm.  (Faster, can produce more confusing diffs.)

      --name-only
          Emit modified filenames only, not diffs

      --remember
          

  -h, --help
          Print help information (use `-h` for a summary)
