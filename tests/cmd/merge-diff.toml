oaf-merge-diff 
Display a diff predicting the changes that would be merged if you merged your working tree.

The diff includes uncommitted changes, unlike `git diff <target>...`.  It is produced by diffing the
working tree against the merge base of <target> and HEAD.

USAGE:
    oaf merge-diff [OPTIONS] [PATH]...

ARGS:
    <PATH>...
            

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help
            Print help information

        --myers
            Use the meyers diff algorithm.  (Faster, can produce more confusing diffs.)

        --name-only
            Emit modified filenames only, not diffs

        --remember
            

    -t, --target <TARGET>
            The branch you would merge into.  (Though any commitish will work.)
