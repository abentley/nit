oaf-squash-commit 
Convert all commits from a branch-point into a single commit.

The last-committed state is turned into a new commit.  The branch-point or latest merge is used as
the parent of the new commit.  By default, the remembered merge branch is used to find the parent,
but this can be overridden.
