oaf-squash-commit 0.1.5
Convert all commits from a branch-point into a single commit.

The last-committed state is turned into a new commit.  The branch-point or latest merge is used as the parent of the new
commit.  By default, the remembered merge branch is used to find the parent, but this can be overridden.
