Convert all commits from a branch-point into a single commit.

The last-committed state is turned into a new commit.  The branch-point or latest merge is used as
the parent of the new commit.  By default, the remembered merge branch is used to find the parent,
but this can be overridden.

Usage: oaf squash-commit [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -b, --branch-point <BRANCH_POINT>
          The item we want to squash relative to

  -m, --message <MESSAGE>
          The message to use for the squash commit.  (Default: \"Squash commit.\")

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')
